# UI Framework

A modern, lightweight UI framework built with React and TypeScript, designed for building scalable and maintainable user interfaces.

## Features

- Built with React 18 and TypeScript for type safety
- Fast development with Vite
- Comprehensive testing with Vitest
- ESLint for code quality
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for efficient development

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` to see the app.

## Recommended Features

Here are some recommended features to enhance this UI Framework:

- **Component Library**: Develop a set of reusable UI components such as buttons, inputs, modals, and navigation bars to provide a consistent design system.
- **Theming System**: Implement a theming mechanism to support light/dark modes and custom color schemes, allowing easy customization of the UI appearance.
- **Responsive Design Utilities**: Add responsive design helpers and breakpoints to ensure components work seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.
- **Accessibility (a11y) Support**: Integrate accessibility features like ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support to make the framework inclusive.
- **Animation and Transition Library**: Include smooth animations and transitions for interactive elements to improve user experience.
- **Form Handling**: Provide robust form components with validation, error handling, and state management.
- **Icon System**: Create a scalable icon library with SVG icons for consistent visual elements.
- **Documentation Site**: Build an interactive documentation site using tools like Storybook or Docusaurus to showcase components and usage examples.
- **Testing Utilities**: Expand testing capabilities with custom hooks and utilities for component testing.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Add support for multiple languages and locales to make the framework globally usable.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading, code splitting, and other performance enhancements for better app speed.
- **Integration with Popular Libraries**: Ensure compatibility and provide guides for integrating with libraries like React Router, Redux, or styled-components.
